# RettApp

## About the project
AFSR (https://afsr.fr) build a smart application in order to collect health data on an international cohort of Rett girls. A partnership has been signed with major companies specialized in information technology for developping this application with the help of students from the Catholic Pontifical University and the Federal University from Rio Grande Sul in Brazil.

## About the application
The main objective of this application is to collect data from a smart watch (hand movments, temperature, bpm) and to add manual inputs (humor, number of seizures, arterial pressure, calories, diet, ...). These data will be stored electronicaly inside the smartphone for each disabled girl.

Once these data are anonymized, they will be transfered to a server to be analysed with datamining solutions in order to find correlations between the differents parameters. This analysis process will be done by Institut Hypercube wich is a French specialist on datamining over Health big data.
