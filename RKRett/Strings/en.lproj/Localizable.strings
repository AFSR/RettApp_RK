"Rett Syndrome About" = "Rett Syndrome is a neurological disorder that affects almost exclusively young girls. The syndrome is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome on the MECP2 gene. It's occurrence is of 1 in every 10.000 girls. There is no cure for Rett Syndrome, affected girls can only manage the symptoms with help of medication, occupational and physical therapy. This app's goal is to provide tracking and logging of daily life aspects of the affected girl. You can see your data in graphical interfaces. Due to Rett Syndrome being a rare disease, many times the affected girls family has to travel a long distance to see the doctor and this puts a limit on how much data doctors have at their disposal. With the data tracking done by the app we will have an amount of data points never seen before in the field of Rett Syndrome.";

Easily create visual consent flows, real-time dynamic active tasks, and surveys using a variety of customizable modules that you can build upon and share with the community. And since ResearchKit works seamlessly with HealthKit, researchers can access even more relevant data for their studies — like daily step counts, calorie use, and heart rate.";
